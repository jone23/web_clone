## About
(Î°úÍ≥† Ïù¥ÎØ∏ÏßÄ)     
   
**LookLock** is a aggregator platform to make it easy to approach all lockdrop projects in Polygon ecosystem.   
   
Till now all of the lockdrop investments have been made on projects‚Äô own websites. Investors should find scattered investment information by themselves, and project launchers should promote and conduct all the lock&drop processes. This is why we devised Lockdrop aggregator platform, LookLock.   
   
We can help investors efficiently access and contribute to new lockdrop events and project launchers launch lockdrop events effectively with the pool of users who have an interest in lockdrop.

   
Examples of which features are powered by LookLock include:   
##### For investor user
* Grasping all lockdrop projects at a glance.   
* Simplifying the lockdrop procedure   

##### For admin user
* launching lockdrop projects     
* Expose new projects to users interested in Lockdrop
